Ariel,

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

However,

- The link to your GitHub repository was nowhere to be found in your document
  or screenshots. 

- A little header or cover page with your name, class, assignment, date, etc.
  is always good to have in any assignment of this type.

- You did not bring the assignment in printed version by the deadline.

- You must submit your assignments on time.



Peace,
